## Findings

1. Download and extract the infected file in isolated environment. Filename: PO#00187.ppt
2. Let's upload the infected file into VirusTotal [Link](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/0289ee3c551ba84d34ab1760d042ab420733d96dbfedfae9718f8eb138c3259b)
3. ‘*What was the general name / category of the malicious file in the analyzed ppt file?*’ Where I used Trellix (FireEye) defined name. 
4. “*Which of the url addresses it communicates with has been detected as harmful by sandboxes?*” Checked from the VirusTotal > Relations > Contacted URLs, there is a URL is shows as malicious. 
5. ‘*What is the name of the htm file that drops to disk?*’ In the VirusTotal > Relations > DroppedFiles, there is only one [.]htm file. 
6. From the VirusTotal > Community I found the “JoeSandbox” reports. [Link](https://www.joesandbox.com/analysis/358430/0/html)
7. ‘*What is the name of the htm file that drops to disk?’* From the “JoeSandbox” report, we can see the Startup section on the process tree of after Powerpnt.exe launch, it open cmd.exe and msta.exe then the suspicious process to running persistence is your answer.
8. ‘*If there was a snort IDS in the environment at the time of the incident, which rules would it match?*’ From the VirusTotal > Behavior > Crowdsourced IDS rules. The first triggered rules is the answer we find.
